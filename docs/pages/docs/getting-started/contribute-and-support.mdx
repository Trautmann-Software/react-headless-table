## Contribute & support

### Want to become a code contributor?
I’ve dedicated a sizeable amount of my own free time to build this project because:
* I was not satisfied with the solutions out there
* I’m a keen advocate of open-source and [I also believe in its power to make our world a better place](https://medium.com/@icflorescu/open-source-capitalism-and-democracy-c71f025b6eba).

### Raising issues and asking for features
* If you find a bug please don’t hesitate to [raise an issue](https://github.com/Trautmann-Software/react-headless-table/issues)
* If you have an idea about a new or missing feature, let’s discuss it [here](https://github.com/Trautmann-Software/react-headless-table/discussions)

<Callout type="info">
  Be considerate when asking for a new feature!<br />
  Is it really something that would be useful for other people, or just an edge case?
</Callout>

### Contributing
Better yet, if you’re willing to put your effort into it, coming up with a pull-request would be fantastic.
So many people <em>take open-source for granted</em>, but far fewer understand its true essence and are generous enough to contribute their own time and skills to a project they find useful.

<Callout type="info">
  New features are developed in the `next` branch.<br />
  If you want to implement a new feature or improve an existing one, make sure to also add an example page and/or
  alter the one(s) already referring to it. It’s not a feature if other people don’t know about it or don’t
  understand how to use it.

### Sponsoring

As mentioned above, I’ve dedicated a sizeable amount of my own free time to build this project. Its maintenance
requires a constant effort. So, if you find [`@trautmann/react-headless-table`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trautmann/react-headless-table) useful and you want to support its
development, you can do so by:

* If you find this project useful, it would help a lot if you could [star the repository](https://github.com/Trautmann-Software/react-headless-table/stargazers),
* [spread the word](http://twitter.com/share?text=Build%20data-rich%20React%20applications%20with%20%40trautmann%2Freact-headless-table&url=https%3A%2F%2Freact-headless-table.trautmann.software&hashtags=react%2Cdatatable%2Cheadless%2Chooks&via=trautmann_soft),

### Why do repository stars matter?
The more stars this repository gets, the more visibility it gains among the Mantine users community. The more
users it gets, the more chances that some of those users will become active code contributors willing to put
their effort into bringing new features to life and/or fixing bugs.<br />
As the repository gain awareness, my chances of getting hired to work on such projects will increase,
which in turn will help maintain my vested interest in keeping the project alive.
